As my first-ever WOD, BrowserHistory1 was, admittedly, a challenging assignment for me in the beginning. I had to resist the urge to resort to the screencast. The first time I attempted the WOD, I realized I had not sufficiently reviewed the readings about HTML; therefore, I had to stop myself and review the material once again. After I felt like I thoroughly understood and remembered the necessary HTML for the assignment, I came back to complete the WOD. Everything went well except for the fact that I had thought, for some reason, that "Rx" required a time under ten minutes instead of fifteen minutes. I reached a time of 12 minutes and I thought to myself, "This is insanely difficult, how do people run through this under ten minutes?" and I reattempted the WOD one more time before I realized that I was re-doing the WOD for no reason. In short, I actually had reached Rx my second time. Needless to say, the moral of this WOD is to look at the instructions carefully in order to prevent unnecessary lost time.
BrowserHistory2 thankfully went a lot smoother, and was perhaps the easiest of the three. I faced the same issue again where I realized I had to review CSS again before attempting the WOD. In my opinion, CSS is definitely easier to navigate and understand than HTML, so I only needed a short review in order to complete the WOD. I attempted one more time and easily achieved Rx.
BrowserHistory3 was probably the most difficult WOD of the three because it required my understanding of <div>, padding, and margins. My first attempt was incredibly long; I had to cut myself off at one point because I realized I was going nowhere in my attempt to create the navigation bar. After watching the screencast once, I tried to replicate its steps (in a simpler fashion, because I felt some steps in the screencast were unnecessary) but I could not yet remember what I needed to do. My second attempt was, thus, another failure. Finally, I watched the screencast one more time before I reached a successful Rx attempt. This was definitely a challenging yet important WOD because I had to change both the HTML and CSS (instead of just one like the prior WODs) in order to get my desired outcome.
