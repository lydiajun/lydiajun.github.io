Now that I have completed the difficult Assignment 1, I definitely feel that I am able to have a meaningful reflection on my progress so far. The first thing that comes to mind is my initial perspective and mindset towards programming back when I was first starting in ITM 352. Learning something completely new is a double-edged sword--on one hand, I felt excited to gain a new skillset; on the other hand, I was nervous and felt that I was behind many of my peers in class who seemed to already be versed in the realm of coding. 

Although this class has proven to be consistently challenging throughout the semester, I'm glad I took on the more positive mindset that pushed me to persevere through my many roadblocks and frustrating moments. I have made it this far because I put a significant amount of effort into this class, by dedicating sufficient time to my assignments every week, studying the documentation of code, and watching screencasts before class.

Assignment 1 has given me a few valuable lessons on good coding practices, which I plan to put into practice for future assignments. Firstly, commenting before writing code. Doing so helped me become significantly more efficient, because I could plan out what I needed in my program in order to meet the requirements of the assignment before writing the code. When I attempted to write code before even knowing what I needed to do at a basic level, it was easy for me to feel caught up and confused on what exactly I was trying to do. Secondly, detailed commenting. This has two aspects. One, commenting where code comes from is important because if I had an error with a certain part of my code, I would know where to refer back to. Two, commenting what code does or what its purpose is is important because often times I would be working on my code at night, and the next day I would forget why I wrote a code that lacked detailed commenting. Thirdly, time management! Even with Professor Port's constant warnings, I severely underestimated the amount of time I would be spending on Assignment 1. Dedicating at least an hour every day to the assignment helped me to lessen the load of work I was faced with towards the deadline, when I was troubleshooting my code. I found that it was helpful to knock out "easy" parts of the assignment first, like crafting my invoice page versus trying to figure out how to use the querystring in my server.js file, in order to save time.
