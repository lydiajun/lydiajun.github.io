A year ago, I entered Shidler with the firm intention to major in Finance. I already knew and understood my interest in analyzing numbers and making decisions based on my analyses. I also understood that the nature of financial careers would match my personality and working style, which I would describe as rational, analytical, and straightforward. 

Due to the low number of courses required for many majors at Shidler, I wanted to take the opportunity to pursue one or two more majors; however, I was unsure of which majors to pursue because I felt uninformed on the other fields of study. In order to combat this dilemma, I joined Delta Sigma Pi, the professional business fraternity, through which I was able to speak with many of my peers at Shidler and learn about why they were pursuing a specific major. If something they mentioned resonated about a major with me, I thought that I could perhaps think about studying such a major.
