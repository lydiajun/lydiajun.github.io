Since childhood, I loved playing around with technology. Using HTML code templates I found online, I built my own websites for fun. I obviously didn't understand the codes, but I liked seeing how changing and adding a bunch of letters and symbols enabled me to establish and tweak interesting features on my website. 

Fast forward to today, and I am now pursuing MIS: a major in which I will actually have to understand HTML, coding, and how "a bunch of letters and symbols" can create the perfect business solution. But why am I taking MIS? 

I didn't always plan to take MIS. A year ago, I actually entered Shidler with the firm intention to major in Finance. I already knew and understood my interest in analyzing numbers and making decisions based on my analyses. I also understood that the nature of financial careers would match my personality and working style, which I would describe as rational, analytical, and straightforward. 

Due to the low number of courses required for many majors at Shidler, I wanted to take the opportunity to pursue one or two more majors; however, I was unsure of which majors to pursue because I felt uninformed on the other fields of study. My wish to combat this dilemma is one of the major reasons why I joined Delta Sigma Pi, the professional business fraternity. At DSP, I was able to speak with many of my peers at Shidler and learn about why they were pursuing a specific major. If something they explained about a major resonated with me, I could perhaps think about studying such a major as well.

I asked everyone, "Why are you pursuing your major?" Out of all the conversations I held with my brothers, the discussions about MIS were most intriguing and surprising to me. Contrary to how I perceived the major, MIS is not entirely about coding, which is the aspect of MIS that frightened me the most. In short, my brothers emphasized that as long as I found technology interesting and a valid candidate for a potential career field, I would do well in MIS and find a passion for MIS. Learning coding is much like learning a language; I simply had to put in the practice and effort.

Hearing such relieving input finally pushed me to take on MIS. I'm interested in technology? Check. I'm open to a technology-related career? Check. I won't be discouraged by the immense effort I will need to put in to learn coding? I wouldn't have checked this off a couple of months ago, but I can now. 

As technological advancement persists forward at a rapid pace, I'm realizing the increasing importance of technology today. I'm excited at the possibility of becoming a knowledgable leader of who can identify the technological solutions an organization needs.
