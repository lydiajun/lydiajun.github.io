Invoice1 is a WOD that enabled me to practice creating an invoice that lists the products bought, including prices and quantities, and calculates the grand total of the purchase by adding the subtotal of the items and the sales tax. You can view more details of the WOD here: [https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html]

I did this WOD a total of three times. The first time was merely an attempt to work through the steps of the WOD without having watched the screencast. Everything was okay in my first attempt until I had to change the numbers to only reflect two decimal places, because I was unsure of where I had to place ".toFixed(2)". My second attempt was okay but I did not reach Rx time. In my third attempt, everything went well and I reached Rx time.

I think the strategy I used last time and this time worked okay. I designate my first attempt to work out the WOD myself to see what I would need to know and perhaps "study" before the next attempt. The second attempt, I would have a more comprehensive game plan and try to attempt Rx time. If I needed the third time, I would most likely be very comfortable with all the steps and finish the WOD quickly to reach Rx time.

Next time, I want to be even more faster and efficient and cut out the third attempt if possible. I should try my best to combine the purposes of the first and second attempt; that is, work out the WOD by myself having studied the necessary code I would apply to the WOD simply by looking at the directions more carefully.
