1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
[E5 Reflecting on Assignment 2](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html
)

Assignment 2 tasked me to expand on what I accomplished in Assignment 1 through the addition of a login and registration page. The customer would be unable to purchase any items or access the invoice page without a successful login or registration.


2. What did you learn from this assignment?

I learned so much! The biggest takeaway from this assignment was probably the usage of a database (in this case, an empty array and a JSON object) to keep track of various users of a website. 


3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I did not work with a partner.


4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

I asked for help from Professor Port in the beginning stages of my assignment because I was unsure how I should approach the post requests from the login and registration page. He started me off by helping me construct the login processing request, setting me on the right path for constructing the registration processing request.


5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

In general, the two assignments were completely different. I wouldn't say Assignment 2 was necessarily easier or had less to do, but the nice thing about Assignment 2 was that I could use everything from Assignment 1 as a starting point--from the website design to the way I used the query string--whereas I had to "start from scratch" in Assignment 1. 


6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

(a) 20%
(b) 40%
(c) 40%


7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

I think I had more fun in this assignment. For example, writing the data validations for registration was enjoyable because I liked thinking of the possible scenarios in which a registration wouldn't work and creating the various if statements. For the last assignment, I want to try having fun as well. I don't think anything necessarily did not work well, but the troubleshooting was definitely a frustrating aspect of the assignment and I predict it will still be a frustrating aspect of the next assignment.


8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

I think the only thing that I would change was the timing of asking for help. I asked Professor Port for help while I was slightly panicking in the beginning because I felt like I had no idea how to approach the assignment, but he made me realize that a lot of the code/concepts I used in Assignment 1 (such as the usage of the query string) and the labs could be used in Assignment 2 as well. Next time, I want to be more prepared before I ask for help.
